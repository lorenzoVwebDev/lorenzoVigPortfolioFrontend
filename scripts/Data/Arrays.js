Programming languages and more in general informatic have always interested me from many points of view such as being able to build you own application for business purposes or just for fun. Since January 2024, I\'ve been studing Web Development with work purposes. It was a very hard endeavour to purse, and throughout my learning journey, I have faced several issues that I have overcome all due to my perseverance and relying on many very good information source broadly renowed by the whole web developers\' community, such as MDN Web, w3Schools and frameworks/libraries/runtime docs (the useful ones, in my opinion). Although I\'ve used many other tools through my learning journey, I have to say that these formal information sources have enached my skills as well as my overall knowledge in terms of web development as no other one has done. I\'m thrilling to start working into this very fascinating new world. Let\'s code togheter.',

This former experience allowed me to undertake many different paths in almost all the different departments related to the energy sector. Mainly, I worked in the SSD addressing issues department, which was related to addressing issues derived from mistakes during the bank periodic payment alignment. I was in charge as the team coordinator, and my main responsibility was to weekly report the data about revenues and outcomes in terms of SSD per client retrieved to the client\'s account managers. Anyway, my superiors put me in many other departments, such as the customer service mail department, SDI retrieval, selling, crossselling, upselling, and others.',
